        The no-frills, straight to the point guide on walking through steps to help you understand

            What is keeping you from being happy? - fear. 
        </div>
        <div>
            Our only fear is rejection. We fear rejection because we are truly
            happy only when we can bring value to someone and connect with them. 
            If we are rejected, we cannot connect with them nor can we be happy
            as they will not want what we can give them. If we only find
            rejection in life, we begin to question if our life is even worth it.
        </div>
        <div>
            This insideous fear can take root at any time, but typically happens
            in childhood, adolescence, and in young adulthood.
            Were you rejected because you tried to make friends but couldn't? Were
            you rejected because of bullying? Were you rejected from lack of parental
            love? Were you rejected because of your body? Were you rejected for something
            that you did/were unable to do? Were you rejected from a potential date/partner? Whatever 
            the source, you started to believe that you were worth less than others 
            for some defect you now had.
        </div>
        <div>
            Unfortunately, some people don't see a way out, and choose to stop
            their story. For those that continue, living near rejection is still
            too frightening, so we avoid approaching our fear by giving something else
            control. Consider these examples and how you can expand it for your
            specific situation:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I can never make any friends, and it is because I am an 
                    introvert. Introverts have a harder time making friends
                    than extroverts, it's a proven fact. I'm okay accepting
                    the fact that I'll have fewer friends because I was born
                    this way. (Whether or not you were born with an introverted
                    disposition, using introversion that you do not have more
                    friends is using introversion as an excuse to not be more
                    open with people who you might be friends with.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    I wish I could spend more time with you, but my work
                    is keeping me from having enough time to hang out with you.
                    I never have time with all of my responsibilities! (Besides
                    situations where you are truly overworked, using your 
                    "busyness" is also an excuse from putting yourself in 
                    situations where you might be required to be vulnerable
                    and yourself with others.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    I'm not ready for another relationship, the last one was
                    more than I could handle. I like to be single for a little
                    bit of time. People tell me that I have high standards and
                    I'd like to find someone who shares the same values as me.
                    (By putting unusually high expectations on potential partners,
                    I can easily reject any situation where I'd meet someone and
                    be required to be vulnerable as no one will be able to check 
                    all of my boxes to be my dream date.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    How am I ever going to get that j-job of being a counselor?
                    I ca-can't st-stop stuttering. How c-could this happen to
                    me? (Stuttering is an indicator that people are so afraid
                    to speak and be rejected, that they are unable to speak
                    clearly because they are so focused on trying to say the
                    right thing.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    I'm a trouble maker. I like to stir up trouble and I like
                    to see what makes people tick, the more the better! I've been
                    doing it since when I was a kid, it is who I am. I didn't live
                    in the best of families, that might have something to do with
                    it but I don't really think of that much anymore. (If you did
                    not feel accepted by your parents, you'd look to do anything
                    in order to be accepted, or noticed, by others. Sometimes this
                    turns into you causing trouble. Bad attention is better than
                    no attention.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    I love fitness, fitness is my life. I like to run in the 
                    morning and make sure I'm counting my calories and reach
                    all of my goals for the day. I could never imagine my waist
                    larger than it is now, that's simply not healthy. The only
                    way to be on top of life is to make sure I stay in tip-top
                    shape. Staying in shape gives me the energy to do all that
                    I need to do everyday. (Staying in shape is important, but
                    excessive fitness is driven from a fear if I do not look a 
                    certain way, people will reject me.)
                </li>
            </ul>
            And we live with these factors controlling us, sometimes for many decades,
            so as long as we don't have to step close into possible rejection.
        </div>
        <div>
            We read books, we take yoga, we try to get more
            money, we tell ourselves we are "strong", we tell ourselves we were
            born this way, we try to play to our strengths, we exercise more,
            we travel, we buy things - but all of this fails when we don't address
            it in the proper order. We are doing the right things, but not in a way
            that makes sense.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="level">
        <h1>Level 1</h1>
        <div>
            The sooner you are able to let control go of your life, you will
            take a great step towards happiness. You cannot control most of what
            happens; you cannot guarantee you will have a job, you cannot guarantee
            you will be able to make friends with whom you want, you cannot guarantee
            you will be healthy all of your life. We think we do have control, but
            it is fact that this is false. All we can ever do is control how we respond
            to life. Authors, philosophers, ancient Greeks and others have
            already figured this out years ago, why don't we listen to what they've
            already said?
        </div>
        <div>
            We might do our best to control our situation,
            but we cannot guarantee with no uncertainty the future will be what
            we have decided. 
            If nothing is for certain, shouldn't we worry? Some do, but I would 
            not recommend it. Why worry if it's going to happen anyways, what does
            worrying solve? Instead of worrying, since it's going to happen anyway,
            make the MOST of the situation that you are given. If you don't already,
            look at the positive of the situation, ALWAYS.
        </div>
        <div>
            If you become hopeless that you aren't in any control,
            you may ask what is the point of all of this. Turn to faith. God has
            given us plans to prosper us and not harm us, and gives us hope
            and a future. Know that the creator of the universe put you here
            for a reason and let that understanding drive you forward.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="level">
        <h1>Level 2</h1>
        <div>
            In the same way that you are letting go of events that happen to you,
            you need to come to let go of others' opinions of you too. By no means,
            do not go off and neglect others, but instead do not let others' opinions
            hold you in fear. These roadblocks (introversion, high standards, busyness, stuttering, etc)
            are all put up by ourselves because we fear what others might think of us.
            In order to take these down, we need to change how we perceive the
            situation, since no matter what we do - we cannot control how people will act
            or how they will think of us. Why worry about something you can't control?
        </div>
        <div>
            Go ahead and take yoga or meditation, learn to release your emotions. If you want
            to start right now, practice 4-7-8 breathing in a quiet place with no distractions. 
            Breathe in for 4 seconds, hold your breath for 7 seconds, and release your breath 
            for 8 seconds. If this is too long, you can shorten up the time, but keep the 
            ratios the same.                        
        </div>
        <div>
            While breathing, you will start to focus on other things rather than your
            breath. This is natural and expected. When these distractions come up, let them
            occupy your attention, but when they are finished - focus back on your breathing.
        </div>
        <div>
            Notice what you are feeling, are you feeling stressed because of a relationship 
            or work? Feel that anxiety, but continue back to breathing and let the emotion
            pass. You need to continue to practice this breathing exercise in order to
            grow your control in releasing all of the negative feelings you've been
            holding onto for far too long.
        </div>
        <div>
            You may have a person or number of people that you can't move past because
            they hurt you in some regard. In order to heal this wound, you must forgive them.
            Let go of your emotion by forgiving them for what they've done, learn from the
            situation, and move on.
        </div>

            By now, you are feeling leaps better than you had been when you started, but 
            there is still more work to do. Ensure your new freedom from fear stays for the 
            long run by dismantling the beliefs and behaviors that held it up for so long.
            If you continue to do the same things you have been, you'll end up back in fear.
        </div>
        <div>
            Our fears come from a hierachial relationship in society; I will fear rejection if 
            I see myself as lower than others. In order to stay far from fear, you need to 
            be equals to another. The elixir to drink is humility, the more humble you become,
            the easier it will be to dismantle these hierarchial relationships you believe in.
            I recommend doing things on this list that fear you the most,
            as those are the things that are going to help you heal the quickest:
        </div>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Choose to go last</li>
                <li>Compliment others</li>
                <li>Seek guidance from smarter people than you</li>
                <li>Listen to others, instead of waiting to respond</li>
                <li>Put yourself in others' shoes</li>
                <li>Choose the more difficult task</li>
                <li>Speak as little about yourself</li>
                <li>Go into situations where you have a chance to be wrong</li>
                <li>Accept unfair things that happen to you</li>
                <li>Get off social media</li>
                <li>Volunteer</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            I also encourage you to think of specific things that would be good in order
            to pass your own roadblock. In the case if I spent too much time being "busy"
            and not spending time with others, I would consider putting some of these into
            practice (if I indeed did all these things and felt these things were keeping
            me busy):
            <ul>
                <li>Watch less tv</li>
                <li>Spend less time on the internet</li>   
                <li>Stop playing those apps on your phone</li> 
                <li>Play less video games</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

    <div class="level">

        <div>
            If you don't have financial stability, now you need to focus
            on this. 
        </div>
        <div>
            The most important foundation for financial stability is a budget.
            It doesn't sound fun, but it is essential. Start tracking what you
            spend, keep track of it. Organize your expenses by category; medical,
            loans, clothing, food, fun, etc. Write down every dollar you spend.
        </div>
        <div>
            Once you've done this for a month or two, start to identify where
            you could spend less. Save up 1 or 2 thousand dollars, and once you've
            saved this, start paying off your debts (smallest to largest). Continue
            knocking out these debts. Once your debts, besides your mortgage, is 
            paid off - save up 3 to 6 months of living expenses. Afterwards, 
            start saving 15% of your income for retirement.
        </div>
        <div>
            Growing financial stability isn't meant to be easy, you will have
            to grow your discipline in order to spend less than you are used to.
            Work on it, every day.
        </div>
        <div>
            This advice is based on the work done by Dave Ramsey on how to become debt free.

            The first part of happiness is the courage to be disliked. If you
            have been following the above steps, you don't feel captive to 
            what others think of you now. What a weight off your shoulders! The next
            step that you must take now is providing value to others, as this is
            the second and final part of happiness. You can only be truly happy
            when you believe you are valuable, and the only way to do that is to
            give to others.
        </div>
        <div>
            Leverage your budget and allocate some money into finding out what you
            are good at, whether that means buying books, coaching sessions or asking
            loved ones or friends. By no means do you have to spend money to do this,
            but more resources here are useful.
        </div>
        <div>
            What do others say about you? Are you patient? Are you analytical? Are you
            good at managing others? Are you good at project planning? Are you compassionate?
            Are you enthusiastic? Do you like to solve problems? Are you adaptible?
            Do you thrive in competition? Do you think about the future? Do you strive
            for harmony?
        </div>
        <div>
            Play to your strengths. Lots of people look to strengthen their weaknesses
            instead - "if I can get better in these areas, I'll be more well-rounded."
            This decision may be rooted in fear that you are not good enough, so it's 
            generally better to focus in on what you are good at.
        </div>
        <div>
            Find work that leverages what you are best at. It doesn't even have to be
            paid at first (if you are able to manage that for a little bit of time - remember,
            having a budget and financial stability becomes before this step) so as long
            as you can still support yourself and anyone that's depending on you.

            Finding work in your strength naturally leads you to communities where you
            are able to help others. Grow in these communities, become an active member.
            Make friends, make connections, get to know others and serve them with what
            you are able to do best. This is happiness.
