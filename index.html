        <div>
            What is keeping you from being happy? - fear.
        </div>
        <div>
            Our only fear is rejection. We fear rejection because we are truly happy only when we can bring value to someone and connect
            with them. If we are rejected, we cannot connect with them nor can we be happy as they will not want what we
            can give them. If we only find rejection in life, we begin to question if our life is even worth it.
        </div>
        <div>
            This insideous fear can take root at any time, but typically happens in childhood, adolescence, and in young adulthood. Were
            you rejected because you tried to make friends but couldn't? Were you rejected because of bullying? Were you
            rejected from lack of parental love? Were you rejected because of your body? Were you rejected for something
            that you did/were unable to do? Were you rejected from a potential date/partner? Whatever the source, you started
            to believe that you were worth less than others for some defect you now had.
        </div>
        <div>
            Unfortunately, some people don't see a way out, and choose to stop their story. For those that continue, living near rejection
            is still too frightening, so we avoid approaching our fear by giving something else control. Consider these examples
            and how you can expand it for your specific situation:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I can never make any friends, and it is because I am an introvert. Introverts have a harder time making friends than extroverts,
                    it's a proven fact. I'm okay accepting the fact that I'll have fewer friends because I was born this
                    way. (Whether or not you were born with an introverted disposition, using introversion that you do not
                    have more friends is using introversion as an excuse to not be more open with people who you might be
                    friends with.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    I wish I could spend more time with you, but my work is keeping me from having enough time to hang out with you. I never
                    have time with all of my responsibilities! (Besides situations where you are truly overworked, using
                    your "busyness" is also an excuse from putting yourself in situations where you might be required to
                    be vulnerable and yourself with others.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    I'm not ready for another relationship, the last one was more than I could handle. I like to be single for a little bit of
                    time. People tell me that I have high standards and I'd like to find someone who shares the same values
                    as me. (By putting unusually high expectations on potential partners, I can easily reject any situation
                    where I'd meet someone and be required to be vulnerable as no one will be able to check all of my boxes
                    to be my dream date.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    How am I ever going to get that j-job of being a counselor? I ca-can't st-stop stuttering. How c-could this happen to me?
                    (Stuttering is an indicator that people are so afraid to speak and be rejected, that they are unable
                    to speak clearly because they are so focused on trying to say the right thing.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Oh don't get me started about my parents. I can't tell you how many arguments we've had,
                    we go on and on about the little things all the time. I'm messed up because of them, I just
                    know it. I'll never be able to date or get ahead because of what happened. (It's truly unfortunate 
                    these things did happen, but putting your blame on others
                    because of the person you've become is also an excuse not to take charge yourself and change.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    I'm a trouble maker. I like to stir up trouble and I like to see what makes people tick, the more the better! I've been doing
                    it since when I was a kid, it is who I am. I didn't live in the best of families, that might have something
                    to do with it but I don't really think of that much anymore. (If you did not feel accepted by your parents,
                    you'd look to do anything in order to be accepted, or noticed, by others. Sometimes this turns into you
                    causing trouble. Bad attention is better than no attention.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    I love fitness, fitness is my life. I like to run in the morning and make sure I'm counting my calories and reach all of
                    my goals for the day. I could never imagine my waist larger than it is now, that's simply not healthy.
                    The only way to be on top of life is to make sure I stay in tip-top shape. Staying in shape gives me
                    the energy to do all that I need to do everyday. (Staying in shape is important, but excessive fitness
                    is driven from a fear if I do not look a certain way, people will reject me.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    I'll be single forever. I'm awkward, make stupid jokes, and am not loveable. No one will ever
                    like me. (You do want to find someone, and that feeling is normal. What isn't healthy is that you downplay
                    your abilities and talents so you can use that as your excuse why you haven't found anyone yet.)
                </li>
            </ul>
            And we live with these factors controlling us, sometimes for many decades, so as long as we don't have to step close into
            possible rejection.
        </div>
        <div>
            We read books, we take yoga, we try to get more money, we tell ourselves we are "strong", we tell ourselves we were born
            this way, we try to play to our strengths, we exercise more, we travel, we buy things - but all of this fails
            when we don't address it in the proper order. We are doing the right things, but not in a way that makes sense.
        </div>

            The sooner you are able to let control go of your life, you will take a great step towards happiness. You cannot control
            most of what happens; you cannot guarantee you will have a job, you cannot guarantee you will be able to make
            friends with whom you want, you cannot guarantee you will be healthy all of your life. We think we do have control,
            but it is fact that this is false. All we can ever do is control how we respond to life. Authors, philosophers,
            ancient Greeks and others have already figured this out years ago, why don't we listen to what they've already
            said?
        </div>
        <div>
            We might do our best to control our situation, but we cannot guarantee with no uncertainty the future will be what we have
            decided. If nothing is for certain, shouldn't we worry? Some do, but I would not recommend it. Why worry if it's
            going to happen anyways, what does worrying solve? Instead of worrying, since it's going to happen anyway, make
            the MOST of the situation that you are given. If you don't already, look at the positive of the situation, ALWAYS.
        </div>
        <div>
            If you become hopeless that you aren't in any control, you may ask what is the point of all of this. Turn to faith. God has
            given us plans to prosper us and not harm us, and gives us hope and a future. Know that the creator of the universe
            put you here for a reason and let that understanding drive you forward.

            In the same way that you are letting go of events that happen to you, you need to come to let go of others' opinions of you
            too. By no means, do not go off and neglect others, but instead do not let others' opinions hold you in fear.
            These roadblocks (introversion, high standards, busyness, stuttering, etc) are all put up by ourselves because
            we fear what others might think of us. In order to take these down, we need to change how we perceive the situation,
            since no matter what we do - we cannot control how people will act or how they will think of us. Why worry about
            something you can't control?

            Go ahead and take yoga or meditation, learn to release your emotions. If you want to start right now, practice 4-7-8 breathing
            in a quiet place with no distractions. Breathe in for 4 seconds, hold your breath for 7 seconds, and release
            your breath for 8 seconds. If this is too long, you can shorten up the time, but keep the ratios the same.
        </div>
        <div>
            While breathing, you will start to focus on other things rather than your breath. This is natural and expected. When these
            distractions come up, let them occupy your attention, but when they are finished - focus back on your breathing.
        </div>
        <div>
            Notice what you are feeling, are you feeling stressed because of a relationship or work? Feel that anxiety, but continue
            back to breathing and let the emotion pass. You need to continue to practice this breathing exercise in order
            to grow your control in releasing all of the negative feelings you've been holding onto for far too long.

            You may have a person or number of people that you can't move past because they hurt you in some regard. In order to heal
            this wound, you must forgive them. Let go of your emotion by forgiving them for what they've done, learn from
            the situation, and move on.

            By now, you are feeling leaps better than you had been when you started, but there is still more work to do. Ensure your
            new freedom from fear stays for the long run by dismantling the beliefs and behaviors that held it up for so
            long. If you continue to do the same things you have been, you'll end up back in fear.
        </div>
        <div>
            Our fears come from a hierachial relationship in society; I will fear rejection if I see myself as lower than others. In
            order to stay far from fear, you need to be equals to another. The elixir to drink is humility, the more humble
            you become, the easier it will be to dismantle these hierarchial relationships you believe in. I recommend doing
            things on this list that fear you the most, as those are the things that are going to help you heal the quickest:
        </div>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Choose to go last</li>
                <li>Compliment others</li>
                <li>Seek guidance from smarter people than you</li>
                <li>Listen to others, instead of waiting to respond</li>
                <li>Put yourself in others' shoes</li>
                <li>Be the first to initiate a conversation</li>
                <li>Choose the more difficult task</li>
                <li>Speak as little about yourself</li>
                <li>Go into situations where you have a chance to be wrong</li>
                <li>Accept unfair things that happen to you</li>
                <li>Get off social media</li>
                <li>Volunteer</li>
            </ul>

            I also encourage you to think of specific things that would be good in order to pass your own roadblock. In the case if I
            spent too much time being "busy" and not spending time with others, I would consider putting some of these into
            practice (if I indeed did all these things and felt these things were keeping me busy):
            <ul>
                <li>Watch less tv</li>
                <li>Spend less time on the internet</li>
                <li>Stop playing those apps on your phone</li>
                <li>Play less video games</li>

            If you don't have financial stability, now you need to focus on this.
        </div>
        <div>
            The most important foundation for financial stability is a budget. It doesn't sound fun, but it is essential. Start tracking
            what you spend, keep track of it. Organize your expenses by category; medical, loans, clothing, food, fun, etc.
            Write down every dollar you spend.
        </div>
        <div>
            Once you've done this for a month or two, start to identify where you could spend less. Save up 1 or 2 thousand dollars,
            and once you've saved this, start paying off your debts (smallest to largest). Continue knocking out these debts.
            Once your debts, besides your mortgage, is paid off - save up 3 to 6 months of living expenses. Afterwards, start
            saving 15% of your income for retirement.
        </div>
        <div>
            Growing financial stability isn't meant to be easy, you will have to grow your discipline in order to spend less than you
            are used to. Work on it, every day.

            The first part of happiness is the courage to be disliked. If you have been following the above steps, you don't feel captive
            to what others think of you now. What a weight off your shoulders! The next step that you must take now is providing
            value to others, as this is the second and final part of happiness. You can only be truly happy when you believe
            you are valuable, and the only way to do that is to give to others.

            Leverage your budget and allocate some money into finding out what you are good at, whether that means buying books, coaching
            sessions or asking loved ones or friends. By no means do you have to spend money to do this, but more resources
            here are useful.
        </div>
        <div>
            What do others say about you? Are you patient? Are you analytical? Are you good at managing others? Are you good at project
            planning? Are you compassionate? Are you enthusiastic? Do you like to solve problems? Are you adaptible? Do you
            thrive in competition? Do you think about the future? Do you strive for harmony?

            Play to your strengths. Lots of people look to strengthen their weaknesses instead - "if I can get better in these areas,
            I'll be more well-rounded." This decision may be rooted in fear that you are not good enough, so it's generally
            better to focus in on what you are good at.

        <div>
            Find work that leverages what you are best at. It doesn't even have to be paid at first (if you are able to manage that for
            a little bit of time - remember, having a budget and financial stability becomes before this step) so as long
            as you can still support yourself and anyone that's depending on you.

            Finding work in your strength naturally leads you to communities where you are able to help others. Grow in these communities,
            become an active member. Make friends, make connections, get to know others and serve them with what you are
            able to do best. This is happiness.
